        <p>

UCR has several initiatives and pathways aimed to provide students with exposure to Data Science. This includes general-education intro courses in Data Science (offered by Statistics and Computer Science), minor in Data Science, B.S. degree in Data Science, and a Masters degree in Business Analytics and Master in Computational Data Science. 

In addition, highly motivated UCR students can apply for the Summer Fellowship program.  Program fellows will be engaged in data science education and participate in team-based projects that involve real data sets provided by industry and community partners. Each fellow will assist in curriculum development or tutoring, and outreach activities that includes visiting high school and middle schools and supporting Summer Camps and hackathons. We welcome students at all levels, but especially targeting current sophomores, juniors and seniors and Master students.
