Western Riverside Council of Governments (WRCOG https://www.wrcog.us/) plans to better understand traffic congestion in the region by studying a recent travel survey and road-side sensor data (with travel patterns between origins and destinations).  Focusing on the most prevalent trip routes, WRCOG seeks to answer questions such as: who's causing the congestion in a city? What are the most congested routes? etc. The goal of the project is to better understand the traffic pattern and plan for future road development.
              As we recover from the pandemic, traffic congestion has attracted the attention of the San Bernardino County. The Western Riverside Council of Governments hopes to better understand traffic congestion in the region by studying recent travel surveys and roadside sensor data provided by Streetlight Data (with travel patterns between origins and destinations).  Focusing on the most prevalent trip routes and WRCOGâ€™s analysis in the Western Riverside region, we seek to answer questions such as: who's causing the congestion in Rialto, SB County, and California as a whole? What are the most congested routes? etc. The goal of the project is to better understand traffic patterns and plan for future road development.
